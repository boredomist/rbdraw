# rbdraw

## DESCRIPTION:

rbdraw is a 2D drawing library for Ruby. It works by wrapping
 some standard X11 functions into an easier to work with way.

To compile and use rbdraw, clone this repository, and then
run `rake make build` to generate a Makefile and build.
You can then run `ruby test.rb` to make sure everything works.

## SYNOPSIS:

Check out the file 'test.rb' for some small examples of how to use
rbdraw. The sample/ directory also has some examples rbdraw programs.
More examples will be added as rbdraw gets more features.
